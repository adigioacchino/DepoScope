# DepoScope - annotate your phage depolymerases

This is the repository related to our manuscript *DepoScope: accurate phage depolymerase annotation and domain delineation using large language models*, currently in submission at Bioinformatics.

## Getting started

- To run the DepoScope tool for new phage protein sequences, go to the the `scripts_clean` folder and run the `VII.DpoDetectionTool.ipynb` notebook.
- To run the benchmarking against other depolymerase detection tools, go to the `benchmark` folder and run the `benchmark_notebook.ipynb`notebook.
