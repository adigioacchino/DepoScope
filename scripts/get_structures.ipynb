In general, they are composed of three domains: a TIM barrel containing the active site residues and chloride ion-binding site (domain A), a long loop region inserted between the third beta strand and the α-helix of domain A that contains calcium-binding site(s) (domain B), and a C-terminal β-sheet domain that appears to show some variability in sequence and length between amylases (domain C) . Amylases have at least one conserved calcium-binding site, as calcium is essential for the stability of the enzyme. The chloride-binding functions to activate the enzyme, which acts by a two-step mechanism involving a catalytic nucleophile base (usually an Asp) and a catalytic proton donor (usually a Glu) that are responsible for the formation of the beta-linked glycosyl-enzyme intermediate.Branching enzyme catalyses the formation of alpha-1,6 branch points in either glycogen or starch. It has an important role in the determination of the structure of starch in plants and of glycogen in animals and bacteria .'},\n",

Common to both ferritins and BFRs is a capacity to store large quantities of iron within their hollow interior, inthe form of a hydrated ferric oxide mineral containing variable amounts ofphosphate anion. However, a major difference between them is that BFR contains up 12 b-type haem groups, while ferritins, as isolated, do not contain haem.The building block for the BFR shell is a protein dimer (subunits A and B) binding the single haem group.

A few exceptions are CBMs in cellulosomal scaffolding proteins and rare instances of independent putative CBMs. The requirement of CBMs existing as modules within larger enzymes sets this class of carbohydrate-binding protein apart from other non-catalytic sugar binding proteins such as lectins and sugar transport proteins.CBMs were previously classified as cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) based on the initial discovery of several modules that bound cellulose . However, additional modules in carbohydrate-active enzymes are continually being found that bind carbohydrates other than cellulose yet otherwise meet the CBM criteria, hence the need to reclassify these polypeptides using more inclusive terminology.Previous classification of cellulose-binding domains were based on amino acid similarity. Groupings of CBDs were called 'Types' and numbered with roman numerals (e.g. Type I or Type II CBDs). In keeping with the glycoside hydrolase classification, these groupings are now called families and numbered with Arabic numerals. Families 1 to 13 are the same as Types I to XIII.

Alpha-amylase is an essential enzyme in alpha-glucan metabolism, acting to catalyse the hydrolysis of alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds of glycogen, starch and related polysaccharides. Although all alpha-amylases possess the same catalytic function, they can vary with respect to sequence. In general, they are composed of three domains: a TIM barrel containing the active site residues and chloride ion-binding site (domain A), a long loop region inserted between the third beta strand and the α-helix of domain A that contains calcium-binding site(s) (domain B), and a C-terminal β-sheet domain that appears to show some variability in sequence and length between amylases (domain C) . Amylases have at least one conserved calcium-binding site, as calcium is essential for the stability of the enzyme. The chloride-binding functions to activate the enzyme, which acts by a two-step mechanism involving a catalytic nucleophile base (usually an Asp) and a catalytic proton donor (usually a Glu) that are responsible for the formation of the beta-linked glycosyl-enzyme intermediate.This domain is found at the C-terminal of various fungal alpha-amylase proteins.

Pectate lyase is responsible for the eliminative cleavage of pectate, yielding oligosaccharides with 4-deoxy-alpha-D-mann-4-enuronosyl groups at their non-reducing ends. The protein is maximally expressed late in pollen development. It has been suggested that the pollen expression of pectate lyase genes might relate to a requirement for pectin degradation during pollen tube growth .Some of the proteins in this family are allergens . Allergies are hypersensitivity reactions of the immune system to specific substances called allergens (such as pollen, stings, drugs, or food) that, in most people, result in no symptoms. A nomenclature system has been established for antigens (allergens) that cause IgE-mediated atopic allergies in humans WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Subcommittee King T.P., Hoffmann D., Loewenstein H., Marsh D.G., Platts-Mills T.A.E., Thomas W. Bull. World Health Organ. 72:797-806(1994). This nomenclature system is defined by a designation that is composed of the first three letters of the genus; a space; the first letter of the species name; a space and an arabic number. In the event that two species names have identical designations, they are discriminated from one another by adding one or more letters (as necessary) to each species designation.The allergens in this family include allergens with the following designations: Amb a 1, Amb a 2, Amb a 3, Cha o 1, Cup a 1, Cry j 1, Jun a 1.Two of the major allergens in the pollen of short ragweed ( ) are Amb aI and Amb aII. The primary structure of Amb aII has been deduced and has been shown to share ~65% sequence identity with the Amb alpha I multigene family of allergens . Members of the Amb aI/aII family include Nicotiana tabacum (Common tobacco) pectate lyase, which is similar to the deduced amino acid sequences of two pollen-specific pectate lyase genes identified in Solanum lycopersicum (Tomato) (Lycopersicon esculentum) ; Cry jI, a major allergenic glycoprotein of Cryptomeria japonica (Japanese cedar) - the most common pollen allergen in Japan ; and P56 and P59, which share sequence similarity with pectate lyases of plant pathogenic bacteria .'},\n",

A few exceptions are CBMs in cellulosomal scaffolding proteins and rare instances of independent putative CBMs. The requirement of CBMs existing as modules within larger enzymes sets this class of carbohydrate-binding protein apart from other non-catalytic sugar binding proteins such as lectins and sugar transport proteins.CBMs were previously classified as cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) based on the initial discovery of several modules that bound cellulose . However, additional modules in carbohydrate-active enzymes are continually being found that bind carbohydrates other than cellulose yet otherwise meet the CBM criteria, hence the need to reclassify these polypeptides using more inclusive terminology.Previous classification of cellulose-binding domains were based on amino acid similarity. Groupings of CBDs were called 'Types' and numbered with roman numerals (e.g. Type I or Type II CBDs). In keeping with the glycoside hydrolase classification, these groupings are now called families and numbered with Arabic numerals. Families 1 to 13 are the same as Types I to XIII.

This entry represents the NLPC/P60 domain, which is a primitive, papain-like peptidase in the CA clan of cysteine peptidases with a Cys126/His176/His188 catalytic triad and a conserved catalytic core . The function of this domain is not clear.A cysteine peptidase is a proteolytic enzyme that hydrolyses a peptide bond using the thiol group of a cysteine residue as a nucleophile. Hydrolysis involves usually a catalytic triad consisting of the thiol group of the cysteine, the imidazolium ring of a histidine, and a third residue, usually asparagine or aspartic acid, to orientate and activate the imidazolium ring. In only one family of cysteine peptidases, is the role of the general base assigned to a residue other than a histidine: in peptidases from family C89 (acid ceramidase) an arginine is the general base. Cysteine peptidases can be grouped into fourteen different clans, with members of each clan possessing a tertiary fold unique to the clan. Four clans of cysteine peptidases share structural similarities with serine and threonine peptidases and asparagine lyases. From sequence similarities, cysteine peptidases can be clustered into over 80 different families . Clans CF, CM, CN, CO, CP and PD contain only one family.Cysteine peptidases are often active at acidic pH and are therefore confined to acidic environments, such as the animal lysosome or plant vacuole. Cysteine peptidases can be endopeptidases, aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, dipeptidyl-peptidases or omega-peptidases. They are inhibited by thiol chelators such as iodoacetate, iodoacetic acid, -ethylmaleimide or -chloromercuribenzoate.Clan CA includes proteins with a papain-like fold. There is a catalytic triad which occurs in the order: Cys/His/Asn (or Asp). A fourth residue, usually Gln, is important for stabilising the acyl intermediate that forms during catalysis, and this precedes the active site Cys. The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them. One subdomain consists of a bundle of helices, with the catalytic Cys at the end of one of them, and the other subdomain is a β-barrel with the active site His and Asn (or Asp). There are over thirty families in the clan, and tertiary structures have been solved for members of most of these. Peptidases in clan CA are usually sensitive to the small molecule inhibitor E64, which is ineffective against peptidases from other clans of cysteine peptidases .Clan CD includes proteins with a caspase-like fold. Proteins in the clan have an α/β/α sandwich structure. There is a catalytic dyad which occurs in the order His/Cys. The active site His occurs in a His-Gly motif and the active site Cys occurs in an Ala-Cys motif; both motifs are preceded by a block of hydrophobic residues . Specificity is predominantly directed towards residues that occupy the S1 binding pocket, so that caspases cleave aspartyl bonds, legumains cleave asparaginyl bonds, and gingipains cleave lysyl or arginyl bonds.Clan CE includes proteins with an adenain-like fold. The fold consists of two subdomains with the active site between them. One domain is a bundle of helices, and the other a β-barrel. The subdomains are in the opposite order to those found in peptidases from clan CA, and this is reflected in the order of active site residues: His/Asn/Gln/Cys. This has prompted speculation that proteins in clans CA and CE are related, and that members of one clan are derived from a circular permutation of the structure of the other.Clan CL includes proteins with a sortase B-like fold. Peptidases in the clan hydrolyse and transfer bacterial cell wall peptides. The fold shows a closed β-barrel decorated with helices with the active site at one end of the barrel . The active site consists of a His/Cys catalytic dyad.Cysteine peptidases with a chymotrypsin-like fold are included in clan PA, which also includes serine peptidases.

Cysteine peptidases with a tertiary structure similar to that of the serine-type aspartyl dipeptidase are included in clan PC.

Inpotato plants, the enzyme has been found to work optimally at 40 degrees C,becoming unstable above this temperature.

A few exceptions are CBMs in cellulosomal scaffolding proteins and rare instances of independent putative CBMs. The requirement of CBMs existing as modules within larger enzymes sets this class of carbohydrate-binding protein apart from other non-catalytic sugar binding proteins such as lectins and sugar transport proteins.CBMs were previously classified as cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) based on the initial discovery of several modules that bound cellulose . However, additional modules in carbohydrate-active enzymes are continually being found that bind carbohydrates other than cellulose yet otherwise meet the CBM criteria, hence the need to reclassify these polypeptides using more inclusive terminology.Previous classification of cellulose-binding domains were based on amino acid similarity. Groupings of CBDs were called 'Types' and numbered with roman numerals (e.g. Type I or Type II CBDs). In keeping with the glycoside hydrolase classification, these groupings are now called families and numbered with Arabic numerals. Families 1 to 13 are the same as Types I to XIII. For a detailed review on the structure and binding modes of CBMs see .This entry represents and . These modules have a core structure consisting of a 3-stranded meander β-sheet, which contain six aromatic groups that may be important for binding.
